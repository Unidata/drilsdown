DRILSDOWN Project (code repo `here <https://github.com/Unidata/drilsdown>`_)
============================================================================

DRILSDOWN is a suite of software tools for geo-science (especially meteorology and oceanography). 

Our goal is *to make 3D multi-variable visualization easier and more scientific*, through: 

#. Plugins, templates, and tools for The Integrated Data Viewer (`IDV <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/>`_, an advanced Java application)

#. `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ tools connecting The IDV to `iPython <https://ipython.org/>`_ (or to its own `kernel <https://github.com/suvarchal/JyIDV>`_).
   
         #. to capture IDV images and animations, as well as full IDV states for replicability
         #. to push and pull digital data between IDV and iPython 
   
#. `RAMADDA <https://geodesystems.com/>`_ repository tools for displaying and publishing `DRILSDOWN Case Studies <https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=9ae3aea4-a86e-4592-b686-20398e698987>`_. 

Our name evokes "*drilling down*" to Cases underpinning a statistical analysis, but Case selection can be anything, like `current weather <https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=de2b8904-0c37-4edd-93c1-b396948c71b2>`_ whenever it is interesting. 


User, please decide your level of interest:

#. I want *Mapes IDV Collection* plugin enhancements to my IDV.

#. I also want my IDV to interact with Jupyter.

#. I also want to publish my IDV+Jupyter "case studies" to an existing RAMADDA repository.

#. I also want to install a RAMADDA repository of my own.

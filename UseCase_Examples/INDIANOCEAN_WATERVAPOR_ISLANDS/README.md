# INDIANOCEAN_WATERVAPOR_ISLANDS

### Over the western equatorial Indian ocean, which is usually dry, there are occasional periods when filaments or "islands" of water vapor in the atmopshere are brought by the winds. These last surprisingly long, even as rain acts to remove the vapor. We wanted to study several such instances.  

A list of begin and end dates was supplied by by Dr. Matt Igel of UC-Davis, based on his blob-tracking results applied to column water vapor (CWV). 

We wanted 3D profiles as well as maps of the column mean, from 2 reanalysis data sources so we can check robustness. For this reason we chose the following [Template IDV bundle](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=2af2e0da-9f30-4dd7-a475-1e5271f4babd), from The Mapes IDV collection / IDV Bundles / Case study templates/ Smallarea_for_teleporting at [this repository](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository). 

A geographical bounding box had to be specified, in this case the same for all cases.

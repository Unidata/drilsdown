DRILSDOWN Project
==================

DRILSDOWN brings the GUI-driven 3D geospatial data visualization power of Unidata's IDV into the world of Jupyter notebooks. It also envisions a higher-level object, a "Case Study", comprising a notebook.ipynb, an IDV bundle.zidv, images, and anything else. Finally, we have a repository structure (in Geode Systems' RAMADDA system) for these Case Study objects, with services.

User, please decide your level of interest:

1. I want some plugin enhancements to my IDV.

2. I also want my IDV to interact with Jupyter.

3. I also want my IDV+Jupyter "case studies" to reside on and interact with a RAMADDA repository.

4. I also want to install a RAMADDA repository of my own.

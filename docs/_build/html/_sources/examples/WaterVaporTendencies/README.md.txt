## This example is based on the paper:

Mapes, B. E., Chung, E. S., Hannah, W. M., Masunaga, H., Wimmers, A. J., & Velden, C. S. (2018). The meandering margin of the meteorological moist tropics. Geophysical Research Letters, 45. https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL07644. Free ReadCube viewing at http://rdcu.be/GpqN. 

A Jupyter notebook reads from a dataset of Analysis Tendencies (AT's, RAMADDA hosted, accessed by OpenDAP link). This AT quantity expresses the rate of moistening of atmopsheric air columns as they flow around and (especially, on average) flow into the deep tropics. The AT is a skewed quantity, with large positive values near the 48mm contour of column water vapor. These large positive values are of special interest, and are hypothesized to be areas of active *cumulus congestus* or half-troposphere-depth convective clouds. Can we see if that is true? The notebook allows us to **"drill down"** and see the cloud scene and synoptic meteorology of these big-AT situations.

Suvarchal, C., and B. E. Mapes, 2018: Cumulus friction in the Asian monsoon of a global model with 7km mesh. Peer-reviewed chapter in INTROSPECT-2016 volume in preparation (Elsevier Press, [PDF](http://yyy.rsmas.miami.edu/users/bmapes/pagestuff/cumulus-friction-asian.pdf)

these notebooks examine the sign of a quantity called KEdot that summarizes momentum flux (kinetic energy work: upscale or downscale?).

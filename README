This is the package for the drilsdown RAMADDA plugin

This plugin relies on the RAMADDA SVN tree to be installed as a sibling of the parent directory of this directory. 
e.g. - 

github
  |
  +------ drilsdown
ramadda-code
  |
  +------ src
  +------ lib

Get the RAMADDA source with:
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/ramadda/code/ ramadda-code


To build run:
ant

This runs the ant script in src/edu/miami/drilsdown

The plugin will be placed in the dist directory
